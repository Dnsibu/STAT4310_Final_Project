# Predicting Life Expectancy for Developing Countries
STAT 4310 Final Project, Spring 2020

**Team 3**: Daisy Nsibu, Laura Moses, Miriam Nyamwaro, Rose Ellison

The Global Heath Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track
of health status as well as many other related factors for all countries. The datasets are made available to the
public for the purpose of health data analysis. For this particular dataset we will be using, health factors for
193 countries from the year 2000-2015 have been collected from the WHO data repository website, as well as
corresponding economic data from the United Nation website.

The goals of this project are:

+ To determine which various predicting variables really affect the life expectancy in developing countries.
+ To determine if Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with various varibales
+ To understand what variables have been the most effective in decreasing/increasing life expectancy
+ To provide insights to these meaningful questions
